| Project name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| [`0x00-Webpack`]| Webpack is a free and open-source module bundler for JavaScript. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. |
| [`0x01-react_intro`]| It aims to learn about **React**, being a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. |
| [`0x02-react_props`]| It aims to learn about Props, They are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes. props stands for properties. |
